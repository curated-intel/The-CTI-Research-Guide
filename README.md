## Introduction
- This CTI Research Guide aims to help practitioners learn more about how to effectively perform the collection, processing, analysis, and production stages of the CTI lifecycle.
- It promotes a repeatable method to keep track of all your sources, categorise them, extract meaningful information, form meaningful takeaways from your research, and document your findings.
- It is also useful from a perspective of knowing and tracking what you have looked at and already digested.
- By refocusing on what is important for your organisation, you will notice improvements on output and stakeholder satisfaction.
